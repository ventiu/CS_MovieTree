Project Two - CS400 @ UW Madison
Group: BA
TEAM: red

Things that went well for this team through project two:
--------------------------------------------------------
Communication was open and frequent and people responded in a timely manner. Everyone was open to constructive critisism and tried their best.

Things that could be improved through future projects:
------------------------------------------------------
Try to split the work more evenly so that one person is less overwhelmed. Have the interfaces be more clear and have more functions.
